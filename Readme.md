## About the Course

[CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/) provides an in-depth introduction to the principles of artificial intelligence. Topics include:
- Search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*)
- Logic and knowledge representation
- Machine learning (supervised and reinforcement learning)
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Planning and optimization

Each project is designed to provide practical experience in implementing AI concepts.
